# TGA Image Format Library
This package is a Rust implementation of the minimal implementation of the Truevision TGA image format. In particular, this repository implements the features necessary to read and write 24 bit uncompressed RGB TGA image files. This is the minimum implementation necessary to be compliant with the TGA image format, as detailed [here](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/tga/).

### Dependencies
The TGA image format library has no external dependencies. It is designed to be a pure Rust implementation of the TGA image format.
